Project Description: Library Management System
The Library Management System is a project designed to manage and maintain the library's resources effectively. This system will track all information related to books, including their availability, cost, and status. Additionally, it will manage data related to branches, employees, and customers, ensuring smooth library operations.

The project involves creating a database named "library" with the following key tables:

Branch: Stores information about different branches of the library.
Employee: Maintains data on library staff, including their positions and salaries.
Books: Keeps track of all the books, their categories, rental prices, and availability.
Customer: Records details of library members.
IssueStatus: Logs information about issued books.
ReturnStatus: Tracks the return of issued books.
With this system, the library can efficiently handle various operations such as tracking issued and returned books, managing employee details, and monitoring customer activities. This helps in maintaining an organized and well-managed library environment.
